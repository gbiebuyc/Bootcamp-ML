1. We concatenate a column of ones because we need the same shape for the 2 matrices.
We choose the value 1 to get theta0 in the multiplication.

2. We square the distances in the cost function to better accentuate the differences I think.

3. The cost function's output represents how bad our estimation is.

4. We want the cost function to tend towards zero because it means that y_hat is perfectly equal to the real y.

5. Matrix multiplication is not commutative because the columns of the second matrix have to have the same number of entries as do the rows of the first matrix.
